I'm set to embark on my graduate journey in the coming autumn, as I'll be joining Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-inspired Intelligence (ISTBI), Fudan University. My research mainly focuses on computer vision and AIGC. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring exciting opportunities ahead!
